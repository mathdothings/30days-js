/*
 * forEach() - executes a determinated callback function for every element of an array collection. You must provide at least one argument in his callback function and two more if needed, the necessary argument is the element and the other two are the index of that element and the original array itself.
 * map() - do practilly the same thing of forEach but it CHANGE the elements, returning a NEW array with modified values. It accepts same args of forEach.
 * filter() - returns a NEW array with all elements that pass a specified contiction in the callback function. Accepts same args from map() e forEach().
 * reduce() - applies a supllied 'reducer' callback function on each element of the array, and also passes the result for the preceding element. It'll return a final 'reduced' value. Four args are possible, (previousElement, currentElement, currentIndex, originalArray).
